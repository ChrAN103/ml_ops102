# MLOps Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the MLOps Fake News Detection project by Group 102.

## Project Overview

This project implements a deep neural network for fake news detection using PyTorch. The focus is on understanding the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle rather than model complexity.

**Dataset**: 44,919 news articles with title, text, and binary classification (fake/real)
**Model**: LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network
**Framework**: PyTorch with comprehensive MLOps tooling
